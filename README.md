# NoRona
<b>This game is still in development phase!</b>
 
The aim is to destroy as many COVID-19 germs as possible! After nearly two grueling years of this novel coronavirus pandemic that has brought the world down to its knees, we all deserve to let off some steam!
 
Developed using Unity 2020.3.19f1 and C#, I believe this just-for-fun project (hence I will not be big on high-end graphics, just testing out the waters with an idea I have fostered upon being inspired by a YouTube ad) will help me grasp a better understanding of Unity, as well object-oriented programming in game development. Feel free to follow me throughout this journey of development <i>(and destruction)</i> as I go along. The more, the merrier!
